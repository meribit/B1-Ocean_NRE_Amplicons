pF = plotQualityProfile(forward_16S_reads) # median drops below Q30 around 260

  # the primers span 515-926, we cut off about 40 bps when removing the primers, so
  # our target amplicon now is about 370
  # with 260 from forward, the reverse would need to be 110 minimum to reach
setwd("/Users/jxd124/Desktop/Meriel/UCPH/B1-Ocean/data_US/DNA_US/DNA_US_AmpliconSequencing/04_FILTERED")
pR = plotQualityProfile(reverse_16S_reads) # median drops below Q30 around 200

  # when doing the trimming step, it's important to make sure we aren't trimming them
  # so short that they cannot overlap, which would cause problems when we try to merge later
  # trimming the forward to 250 and reverse to 190 would leave us with around 70 bps overlap
